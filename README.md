# Web Scraping with Python Code Samples

These code samples are for the book <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920078067.do">Web Scraping with Python</a>

If you're looking for the first edition code files, they can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/REMitchell/python-scraping/tree/master/v1">v1</a> directory.

Most code for the second edition is contained in <a href="https://jupyter.org/install.html">Jupyter notebooks</a>. Although these files can be viewed directly in your browser in Github, some formatting changes and oddities may occur. I recommend that you clone the repository, install Jupyter, and view them locally for the best experience.

The web changes, libraries update, and I not infrequently make mistakes or typos. If you think you've spotted an error, please feel free to make a pull request against this repository.
